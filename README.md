# arduino_environment_sensing
Arduino implementation of various sensors to determine enviromental factors such as wind velocity and direction, attitude angles (pitch, roll, yaw), magnetic north reference, and GPS coordinates. Data communications are through a RF transciever with a wireless working frequency band of 433.4 MHz to 473.0 MHz. For use in transient applications such as hot air balloons or drones and other AUV's.
